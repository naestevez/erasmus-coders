#Erasmus Coders

We are coders and students in the Erasmus programme here to help eachother out, share resources, 
work on tutorials/coding challenges or talk about student life.

This website (still in progress) will showcase coding/design projects, provide many online resources, 
and have an access point to join our Slack group.

Contributors are welcome.
